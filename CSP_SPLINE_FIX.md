# Content Security Policy (CSP) Fix for Spline 3D Components

## Issue Description

The Spline 3D scene was failing to load due to Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions. The error indicated that the CSP directive "connect-src" was blocking access to `https://unpkg.com/@splinetool/modelling-wasm@1.10.12/build/process.wasm`, which is required for Spline 3D components to function properly.

## Root Cause

The original CSP configuration in `next.config.ts` did not include the necessary domains that Spline 3D components require to load WASM files and other resources from external CDNs.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated CSP Directives

**File**: `next.config.ts`

#### Before:
```javascript
"connect-src 'self' https://formspree.io https://prod.spline.design https://ltmwapridldsxphvduer.supabase.co https://api.calendly.com"
```

#### After:
```javascript
"connect-src 'self' https://formspree.io https://prod.spline.design https://unpkg.com https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://ltmwapridldsxphvduer.supabase.co https://api.calendly.com"
```

### 2. Added Spline Support to Multiple CSP Directives

#### script-src
- **Added**: `https://unpkg.com` to allow loading of Spline JavaScript modules

#### font-src
- **Added**: `https://unpkg.com` to allow loading of any fonts used by Spline components

#### worker-src (New)
- **Added**: `'self' blob: https://unpkg.com https://prod.spline.design` to support WASM workers

#### child-src (New)
- **Added**: `'self' blob: https://unpkg.com https://prod.spline.design` to support web workers

#### media-src (Updated)
- **Added**: `data: blob: https://prod.spline.design https://unpkg.com` to support base64-encoded videos for robot animations

### 3. Complete Updated CSP Configuration

```javascript
"Content-Security-Policy": [
  "default-src 'self'",
  "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://prod.spline.design https://unpkg.com https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://calendly.com",
  "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com https://cdn.jsdelivr.net",
  "img-src 'self' data: blob: https: http:",
  "font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com https://unpkg.com https://cdn.jsdelivr.net",
  "connect-src 'self' https://formspree.io https://prod.spline.design https://unpkg.com https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://ltmwapridldsxphvduer.supabase.co https://api.calendly.com",
  "frame-src 'self' https://calendly.com",
  "worker-src 'self' blob: https://unpkg.com https://prod.spline.design",
  "child-src 'self' blob: https://unpkg.com https://prod.spline.design",
  "media-src 'self' data: blob: https://prod.spline.design https://unpkg.com",
  "object-src 'none'",
  "base-uri 'self'",
  "form-action 'self' https://formspree.io",
  "frame-ancestors 'none'",
  "upgrade-insecure-requests"
].join('; ')
```

## Security Considerations

### Domains Added
1. **https://unpkg.com**: Required for Spline WASM files and modules
2. **https://cdn.jsdelivr.net**: Already included but ensured consistency across directives

### Security Maintained
- Only added the minimum required domains for Spline functionality
- Maintained strict CSP for all other resources
- No wildcards or overly permissive rules added
- All existing security measures remain intact

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: unpkg.com is a trusted CDN for npm packages
- **Controlled Access**: Only specific resource types allowed from these domains
- **Maintained Restrictions**: Still blocking unauthorized script execution and resource loading

## Testing Performed

1. **Build Test**: Confirmed application builds successfully with updated CSP
2. **Development Server**: Verified application starts without errors
3. **Security Check**: All security validation scripts pass
4. **CSP Validation**: Confirmed CSP syntax is correct and well-formed

## Expected Results

After this fix, the Spline 3D components should:
- Load WASM files from unpkg.com without CSP errors
- Render 3D scenes properly in the browser
- Function with all interactive features intact
- Maintain security through controlled resource access

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Check Browser Console**: No CSP violation errors related to Spline
2. **3D Scene Loading**: Spline components render correctly
3. **Network Tab**: WASM files load successfully from unpkg.com
4. **Functionality Test**: 3D interactions work as expected

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the CSP can be quickly reverted by removing the added domains:

```javascript
// Remove these from the respective directives:
// - https://unpkg.com
// - worker-src and child-src directives (if causing issues)
```

## Documentation Updates

- Updated `SECURITY.md` to reflect CSP changes for Spline support
- Added notes about WASM loading support in security documentation

## Deployment Notes

- Changes are backward compatible
- No environment variable changes required
- Safe to deploy to production immediately
- Monitor for any new CSP violations in production logs
